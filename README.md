# Cricket PoseNet: AI Shot Recognition

## Introduction

Cricket PoseNet: AI Shot Recognition is a project dedicated to the precise classification of cricket shots, employing advanced computer vision techniques, including Detectron2 and Deep Learning. It leverages Pose Detection to categorize cricket shots based on the specific poses adopted by players in images, providing invaluable insights for cricket analysis and training. The system aims to automate shot classification, reducing subjectivity and offering support for coaches, analysts, and cricket enthusiasts.

## Objective

The core objective of this project is to automate the classification of cricket shots using player poses in images. It addresses the time-consuming and subjective nature of manual shot classification. The project assembles a diverse dataset of cricket shots, applies data augmentation techniques, and uses the Detectron2 library for precise pose detection. A neural network architecture is carefully designed for shot classification based on pose keypoints, leading to objective shot classification.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to bridge the gap between technology and cricket analysis. Key motivations include:

- **Performance Analysis**: Providing accurate shot classification for assessing player performance and strategic decisions.
- **Training Enhancement**: Aiding aspiring cricketers with real-time feedback on shot selection and technique.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Enabling data-driven decision-making for cricket teams and analysts.
- **Automation**: Reducing the time and effort required for manual shot classification.
- **Technological Advancements**: Leveraging advanced computer vision tools for accurate analysis.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Software Requirements
