        Sometimes playing a defensive shot is a better choice than the attacking one, owing to the merit of the delivery. You can play defensive shots on the front foot or back foot. Letâ€™s look at both kinds of defensive shots in detail.

      <Shotcard
        title="1. Forward Defence"
        text=" The forward defence or the front-foot defence is the best choice when the ball is pitched around the good length and the line of the ball is threatening the stumps. To play this shot, move your front foot towards the pitch of the ball and get your head near your knee before bringing the bat down to connect the ball. "

      <Shotcard
        title="2. Back Foot Defence"
        text="It is also similar to the front foot defense we mentioned above. But here, the batsman transfers his weight onto the back foot, stands tall, and blocks the ball. The back foot defense is mainly used to face good and short-length deliveries on the body line."
